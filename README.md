# Workl Developers challenge

Thank you for taking the time to attempt this challenge.

These challenges are used to evaluate candidates of all skill levels, so please complete them as you would in a working environment to a level you feel is an accurate representation of your skill set.
We aren't necessarily looking for a complete solution, but a working sketch that shows your approach and thinking.

Each part should take 1-2 hours depending on experience, enter as many notes as you like (or none at all!). 
These will be used to create talking points during your interview.

If you have any questions or would like to clarify any details, please email stefano.degrandis@workl.co

Good luck!


## Frontend

For this challenge we would like you to create a React app that allows a user to answer all the `enabled` questions saved on `questions.json` and show the answers. This can be displayed either visually or in the console.

What we would like to see in this challenge:
- A clear and organised code
- A Redux store setup or any other state management
- Usage of a component library (don't spend time on styling - take advantage of the component library)


## Backend

For this challenge we would like you to create a GraphQL api that consumes the questions on `questions.json` and enables the following functionality:

- Get all questions 
- Get all enabled questions
- Get question by ID

what we would like to see in this challenge:
- A clear and organised code
- A docker image of this api
